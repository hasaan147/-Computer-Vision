# Image Loading Script with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script (`images.py`) that demonstrates how to load and display images using the OpenCV library. The script is simple to use and is designed to help users understand how to work with images in Python using OpenCV.

## What Does the `images.py` Script Do?

The `images.py` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Loads an Image**: It reads an image from a specified file path using OpenCV's `cv2.imread()` function.
2. **Displays the Image**: The loaded image is displayed in a new window using OpenCV's `cv2.imshow()` function.
3. **Handles Errors**: If the specified image path is incorrect or the file is not accessible, the script provides an error message.
4. **Waits for User Input**: The displayed image window will remain open until a key is pressed. After pressing a key, the window will close automatically.

## What Kind of Images are in the Images Folder?
The images folder contains images of childrens from age 4 to 10.
